# History Branch - My Personal Site

This is the history branch. It stores important lessons from failed branches that have been deleted. How so? For failed branches which contain an important lesson, I will create a pull request for those branches to this branch. Then, I will cancel the pull request and include comments explaining why the failure occured and the important lesson to take away. Afterwards, I can delete the failed branch. If there is ever any point in the future in which I need to resurrect the branch, I can do so through the canceled pull request history of this history branch.
